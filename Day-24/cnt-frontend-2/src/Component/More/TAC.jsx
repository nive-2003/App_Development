          <h3>Welcome to Mavericks!</h3>
          <p3>
            This section outlines our relationship with you. It includes a
            description of the Service, defines our Agreement, and names your
            service provider.
          </p3>
          <h4>1. Accounts</h4>
          <p4>
            You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your
            password somewhere safe, because you’re responsible for all activity
            associated with your account. If you suspect someone else is using
            your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must
            have reached the age of consent for online services in your country
            to use Udemy.
            <br />
            <br />
            You need an account for most activities on our platform, including
            to access content and to submit content for publication. When
            setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and
            continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a
            valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your
            account and everything that happens on your account, including for
            any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using
            your account without your permission. This means you need to be
            careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to
            someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us to
            request access to an account, we will not grant you such access
            unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove
            you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a
            user, the account of that user will be closed.
            <br />
            <br />
            You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else.
            You are responsible for what happens with your account and Udemy
            will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who
            have shared account login credentials. You must notify us
            immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your
            account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach
            of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some
            information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of
            your account.You can terminate your account at any time.

            behavior violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines, or if we believe

          <h9>6.Using Mavericks at Your Own Risk</h9>
          <p9>
            Anyone can use Mavericks to create and publish content and users to
            interact for post
            <br /> content and learning. Like other platforms where people can
            post content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use
            Mavericks at your own risk.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for
            legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality
            of content.
            <br /> We do not exercise any editorial control over the content
            that is available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in
            any manner the
            <br /> reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the
            content. If you access content, you rely on any information provided
            by an instructor at your own risk.
            <br />
            <br />
            By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you
            consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. Mavericks has no
            responsibility to keep
            <br /> such content from you and no liability for your access or
            enrollment in any course or other content, to the extent permissible
            under applicable law. This <br />
            also applies to any content relating to health, wellness, and
            physical exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in
            the strenuous nature
            <br />
            of these types of content, and by accessing such content you choose
            to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily
            injury, disability, or <br />
            death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make
            before, during, and after your access to the content.
            <br />
            <br />
            When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites
            that we don’t own or control. We are not responsible for the content
            or any other <br />
            aspect of these third-party sites, including their collection of
            information about you. You should also read their terms and
            conditions and privacy policies.
